        lets talk about chestpain types:
    </h3>
    <p>
        1.<strong>Typical angina (TA) </strong><br>is defined as substernal chest pain precipitated by physical exertion or emotional stress and relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. Women and elderly patients are usually have atypical symptoms both at rest and during stress, often in the setting of nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
       <br>
       <br>
       2.<strong>Atypical angina (ATA)</strong> <br>implies that the complaint is actually angina pectoris, though not conforming in every way to the expected or
       classic description; noncardiac chest pain implies confidence that the problem doesn’t rest with the heart, whereas
       atypical chest pain says little more than there is something
       in or about the chest that bothers the patient, and to some
       extent concerns the physician, but which he or she is at a
       loss to explain or is unwilling to commit to a diagnosis—
       bluntly put, it can be caused by anything
       <br>
       <br>
       3.<strong>Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP)</strong> <br>is a term used to describe chest pain that resembles heart pain (also called angina) in patients who do not have heart disease. The pain typically is felt behind the breast bone (sternum) and is described as oppressive, squeezing or pressure-like.
       <br>
       <br>
       4.<strong>Silent (asymptomatic) myocardial ischemia (SMI) </strong><br>is defined as a transient alteration in myocardial perfusion in the absence of chest pain or the usual anginal equivalents.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
<strong>To diagnose</strong>, will first do a physical exam and ask about any medical history the person has or underlying conditions.<br>
They may take a person’s blood pressure and will often order an electrocardiogram (ECG) to look at the heart’s functioning.<br>
Other tests that can help a make a diagnosis include:<br>
.computed tomography (CT) scans to give an image of the heart<br>
.exercise tolerance tests performed on a treadmill<br>
.blood cholesterol profile to asses for risk factors, including atherosclerosis<br>
.a coronary angiography to see how well blood flows through the arteries<br>
In some cases, run C-reactive protein (CRP) tests. Higher levels of CRP may indicate a higher risk of being diagnosed with heart disease.<br>

<h3>
    lets talk about Resting ECG results:
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Resting ECG</strong> – you lie down for this type of ECG. No movement is allowed during the test, as electrical impulses generated by other muscles may interfere with those generated by your heart. This type of ECG usually takes 5 to 10 minutes.
<br>
The Electrocardiogram (ECG / EKG) Test is priced in the range of Rs 150 to Rs. 300.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
    lets talk about Exercise induced angina:
</h3>
<p>
    Stable angina is usually triggered by physical activity. When you climb stairs, exercise or walk, your heart demands more blood, but narrowed arteries slow down blood flow.
    <br>
    During times of low oxygen demand — when you're resting, for example — your heart muscle may still be able to function on the reduced amount of blood flow without triggering angina symptoms. But when you increase the demand for oxygen, such as when you exercise, angina can result.

</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> ST depression induced and slope of the peak exercise ST segment can be retrived by Maximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>number of major vessels colored by flourosopy: can be retrived by CAD diagnosis.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen.<br>
    Diagnose thalassemias using blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and special hemoglobin tests. A CBC measures the amount of hemoglobin and the different kinds of blood cells, such as red blood cells, in a sample of blood.
